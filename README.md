#Library Management System

Project Description

The Library Management System is a simple Java-based project designed to manage books in a library. It allows users to perform basic library operations like adding books, viewing the list of books, and managing book-related data. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

Project Structure

•	Book.java

Represents the Book entity with attributes such as book title, author, publication year, and more. This class includes getter and setter methods to encapsulate the data and manage book details effectively.
 
  •	Library.java
  
  Implements the functionality of the library system, including operations such as:
	•	Adding books to the library
	•	Viewing the list of all available books
	•	Managing the collection of books within the library using appropriate data structures
	
 •	Main.java
 
Acts as the entry point of the program. It provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the Library Management System and access its features.
